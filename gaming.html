<h1>Tigerr's Gaming</h1>
<p>Welcome to the gaming section of my website. This is where I'm gonna regularly talk about gaming related stuff.</p>
<p>The first thing I'm gonna talk about is that my favorite game series is Animal Crossing. I know that a fucking adult shouldn't be playing a kids' series. I've basically been playing the series for over 10 years, starting with Wild World.</p>
<p>My favorite story heavy game that I played so far is Detroit: Become Human. I played it in Dec. 2018, a few months after it released, and I loved it.</p>
