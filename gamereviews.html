<h1>Tigerr's Game Reviews</h1>
<p>Welcome to the game review section of my website. This is where I'll regularly review games.</p>
<p>These reviews are gonna be straight to the point with no filler words/sentences. They'll also be short (no more than 5 sentences) with a score at the end. The score will be out of 100%.</p>

<li><b>Animal Crossing (GameCube)</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Animal Crossing: Wild World</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Animal Crossing: City Folk</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</b> - This might be the newest AC game as of the review in June 2023, but that doesn't mean it's the best one. It's good, but does get boring pretty quickly if not played with friends. What doesm't help is that the tools in the game break after a certain amount of uses, which I assume is supposed to feel like it's an actual island life. A pro is that you can have a s big of a pumpkin patch as you want to bring in passive income as long as you water it daily and get the pumpkins when they grow in triplets every other day.

<li><b>Minecraft (Java)</b> - As of the review in June 2023, </li><br>
<li><b>Minecraft (Bedrock)</b> - As of the review in June 2023, this version of Minercaft is pretty good, granted it's heavily played by console players. It doesn't need to be a great version since it's ran on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and smartphone hardware. It also doesn't need to be complicated since it's player base seems to be towards kids. This version of the game doesn't have a lot of punch like Bedrock since this version can't do mods well, if at all. It does good enough since it's a great starter for any new player to the game.

<h1>Tigerr's Movie Reviews</h1>
<p>Welcome to the movie review section of my website. This is where I'll regularly review movies.</p>
<p>This is gonna be like the gaming reviews where they'll be based off of a 100% score.</p><br>
<li><b>M3GAN</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>Cocaine Bear</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>The Simpsons Movie</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>The Spongebob Squarepants Movie</b> - N/A</li><br>
<li><b>The Hero Of Color City</b> - This movie reminded me too much of Toy Story, mostly because of the talking objects. It's dumb, weird, and fugly. What surprised me is that it released in goddamn 2014. The animation looked way too goddamn amateur. [37.9%]</li><br>
